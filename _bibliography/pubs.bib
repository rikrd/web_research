First processing section identifies an estimated train that is a time series of candidate frequencies, each selected for a different one of the segments, arranged over a plurality of the unit segments and that has a high likelihood of corresponding to a time series of fundamental frequencies of a target component. Second processing section identifies a state train of states, each indicative of one of sound-generating and non-sound-generating states of the target component in a different one of the segments, arranged over the unit segments. Frequency information which designates, as a fundamental frequency of the target component, a candidate frequency corresponding to the unit segment in the estimated train is generated for each unit segment corresponding to the sound-generating state. Frequency information indicative of no sound generation is generated for each unit segment corresponding to the non-sound-generating state.},
