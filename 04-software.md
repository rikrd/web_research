Geomerative is a library for Processing. It extends 2D geometry operations to facilitate generative geometry. Includes a TrueType font and an SVG interpreters. This library exposes the shapes (such as vector drawings or typographies) in a more approchable way. Geomerative simplifies access to the paths, the handles and the points, making it easy to develop generative typography and geometry pieces in Processing.

Fisica is a wrapper around the 2D physics simulation library JBox2D. It tries to make it much easier to create physical models by exposing an object oriented API similar to PPhys2D physics library for Processing. This library was designed mainly for educational purposes.
